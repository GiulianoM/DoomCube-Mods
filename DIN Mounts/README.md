# 2020 Mounts

These are mounts that allow you to attach a standard DIN ~~Djarin~~ Rail (35mm wide, 7.5mm tall) to the top or bottom skirt side pieces on the DoomCube mods.

I recommend it for the top electronics bay.

If you have heavy Power Supplies in the bottom electronics bay you may want to use the [2020 Mounts](../2020%20Mounts/), or just use the stronger steel DIN Rail mounts instead of the aluminum ones.

It will accomodate DIN Rail lengths of:

* 470mm for 350 size.
* 420mm for 300 size
* 370mm for 250 size.

These will fit on top of the side skirt pieces for the 350/300/250, the holes are aligned to match.

You will need 20mm M3 screws to mount to the skirts.

The mounts have two holes in the top for optional M3 heat inserts, for threading M3 screws to clamp the rails - however I didn't need them, the fit was tight enough.
