# 6020 Double Fan Mount

This adds a double fan mount for 60mm fans (60x20) in the center skirt section of the DoomCube.

The center skirt section on the DoomCube is the same size for 250/300/350, so it will fit all of them.

This mod keeps the slot in the side for the insert piece, which is the stock blank from the DoomCube repo.

To get the mesh effect, slice it with these settings:

* 5-6 perimeters.
* 0 top and bottom layers
* Infill of your choice and density (30% shown for hex)


The back side of the skirt piece has holes to fit M4 threaded inserts, [M4x6.3x4.7](https://www.amazon.com/M4x4-7mm-OD6-3mm-Inserts-Plastic-Staking/dp/B08T9TXS9S).

You will need M4 25mm screws to attach the fans.
